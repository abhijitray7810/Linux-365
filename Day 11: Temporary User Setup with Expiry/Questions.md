As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named ammar requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:



Create a user named ammar on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2027-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.
