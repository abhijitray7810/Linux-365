Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:



a. Create a user named mark on App server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.


b. Assign a unique UID 1144 and designate the home directory as /var/www/mark.

Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.
